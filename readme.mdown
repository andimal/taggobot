--------

1. Get your tumblr tags in a nice, tidy, json file.
2. You can then upload the json file to a server and grab it from a tumblr theme.

The github pages branch has a couple differences. It wouldn't allow the js to post to the python file, so I jsonp to that thang on my server.
- js: .ajax call instead of .post to post jsonp, remove .parseJSON
- python: return the tags with the jsonp callback
